# VideoDownloader
A python script created using selenium to download videos off youtube from a online video converter. It should not be used to do piracy of any kind. I do not take any responsibility of any wrong use of this script to violate youtube policies and that the rights of the video owners. This is just a recreational piece of code. NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR REUSED.  HOW TO USE Create a list of Songs and make sure you have the same file path copied over in the script where the script is trying to load the song names  Why Sharing on Github? It could be used as an implementation example for selenium for beginers. Anyhow it is not of the best quality.
